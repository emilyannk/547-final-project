This repo contains the Jupyter code I used for my final project for CIST 547 at UAlbany, which involved working from the [Digital-Preservation](https://github.com/cases-umd/Digital-Preservation) notebook to generate inventories and perform data analysis on files from a publicly available dataset. It also uses locally installed [Brunnhilde](github.com/tw4l/brunnhilde) and [bulk_extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor) for further data. The dataset used was the [Govdocs1 dataset](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/file-corpora/files).

Instructions on how to run the notebook (and its prerequisites) yourself are in results-1_charts.ipynb.
